1) To start working with the program, download and install Tesseract on your computer for all users. Specify the path to the tesseract bin file. https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
2) Download poppler-24.07.0 from GitHub and put it in the C:/ folder on your computer
3) Place the PDF file whose text you want to recognize and put it in the main directory of the program

The principle of the program is that the PDF file is converted into a PNG image and then converted into a new PDF with text. Example: using it on scanned books of 300 MB size turns the original file into a file of 3 megabytes
